          <h2>How To Start Programming</h2>
          <p>
            The “How To Start Programming” workshop began with the core council of
            MTC first introducing the club’s objectives, events, opportunities,
            and then the team and faculty-in-charge to the participants. The
            speakers then continued to discuss programming, the multiple levels of
            programming languages, what BITS Pilani offers, and getting started
            with programming. They shared information and ideas regarding
            competitive programming and open-source projects, as well as a
            carefully curated list of resources that can help in learning the
            languages of the participants’ choice.

          <h2>MATLAB Workshop</h2>
          <p>
            The “MATLAB Workshop '' began with the two speakers introducing the UI
            of MATLAB and its basic syntax and functionalities. They moved on to
            talking about the data types, comments, arrays, linspace, matrix
            element-wise operations, and indexing. Next, they solved two sample
            problems that aimed to demonstrate problem-solving and plotting graphs
            in MATLAB.

          <p>
            The “VS Code” workshop began with the core council members of MTC,
            Heramb and Akash first introducing the agendas of the workshop and
            giving a brief intro to VS Code to the participants. The speakers then
            continued to discuss programming, the various uses of VS code, tips
            and tricks, and making it personalized to one’s liking. They shared
            information and ideas regarding API integration and various
            intricacies it offers such as built in AI integration, as well as a
            carefully curated list of resources that can help in familiarizing the
            VS Code environment.

          <h2>Typing Contest</h2>
          <p>
            The Typing Contest is Microsoft Tech Club’s flagship event, and this
            time it challenged participants’ auditory comprehension skills along
            with their typing speed. The competition was held in the Computer Lab
            in 333, and allowed participants to re-try twice in two hours if they
            were unsatisfied with their performance. Each hour (of the three) had
            four distinct audio clips and the participants were randomly given one
            of them to listen to and type. Time started from when the participant
            received their email and ended when they submitted the Google Form.
            Participants were evaluated based on their speed and accuracy. There
            will be 9 winners in total, 3 from each hour.

          <h2>SignQuest</h2>
          <p>
            The MTC SignQuest is a promotional event for the ESL Global Summit
            Generative AI Competition, being organized by MTC at the International
            Conference on Computational Intelligence and Network Systems (CINS
            2023), which is being held at BITS Pilani Dubai Campus in hybrid mode.
            The competition was held at the vending machine area and allowed
            participants in pairs to take part. One in the duo had to answer the
            quiz using the searching skills of the second participant. The aim of
            the competition was to spread awareness regarding Emirati Sign
            Language, and of the Generative AI competition.

          <h2>ThinkAI’23</h2>
          <p>
            ThinkAI’23 was a competition that attempted to scour for talented
            students with an idea for an AI-powered solution to the world’s
            problems so as to provide them with mentorship and guidance and
            prepare them for the 2024 Microsoft Imagine Cup. A total of 16 teams
            registered for the competition, and 14 teams presented their pitches
            to 8 different judges. The ideas ranged from using AI in the fields of
            sustainability, healthcare and food science to mental health,
            philanthropy and education, to name just a few. The winners of the
            competition were Team Tech Titans (Sanober Sarfaraz Ahmed and Harsh
            Garg) and Team IntelliTrack (Anurag Kumar Jha, Mohammed Husamuddin,
            Sstuti D Mehra, Abdul Rahmaan Ansari).
